# Overview

Demonstrates how to use Azure DevOps to test and publish Custom Question Answering (formerly QnA Maker) Knowlegebases
from a editing stage/environment to a production stage/environment.

__What does this sample demonstrate__:

* Integrate Accuracy Test for Knowledgebases into Azure Pipelines
* Record Knowledgbase data, test data set and test result with Azure Storage
* Collect Active Learning Feedback data from production and display it in the editing Knowledgebase

__What doesn't this sample demonstrate__:

* How to increase accuracy of a Knowledgebase

## Model Tracking and Dataset Management

In case of Custom Question Answering the Knowledgebase data resembles the model. We track the dataset/model within
Azure Pipelines as a `Pipeline Artifact` and upload it to a storage account. Where it can be downloaded and redeployed.

## Dependency Management

This sample uses Azure Pipelines, Python scripts to interact with the Custom Question Answering API and an Accuracy Test tool
written in TypeScript.

* For the TypeScript part `npm` is used and the dependencies are managed in [package.json](accuarcy_test/package.json).
* For the Python part `pip` is used and the dependencies are managed in [pip-requirements.txt](kb/pip-requirements.txt).

> We recommend to use the devcontainer provided which has all tools preinstalled. Select `Remote Containers: Open Folder in Container...` from the VSCode command palette and navigate to this samples subfolder `samples/mlops-for-azure-custom-question-answering/`

# Getting Started

## Prerequisite

1. Docker & VSCode with Remote-Containers extension [installed](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_getting-started)
1. Fork of this repo on your [GitHub Account](https://github.com/join)
1. Create a [GitHub PAT]((https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)) with scope `admin:repo_hook`
1. Azure DevOps Organization with an [empty new project](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/projects/create-project?view=azure-devops&tabs=preview-page)

## Create the Azure resources

Let's go and create the resources we need for this sample:

* Custom Question Answering Service where we maintain content (EDIT)
* Custom Question Answering Service where we serve content (PROD)
* Storage Account to track and record artifacts

The provided IaC script will create a `.env` file with all settings and keys to set up
the pipelines in a second step. The scripts are bash scripts, recommend to use the provided devcontainer (see [here](#dependency-management) for instructions).

From within the `samples/mlops-for-azure-custom-question-answering` folder execute the following command and exchange `<salt>` with any string you like.
The salt is there to create globally unique names, which is required for the type of Azure Resources we are creating.

```bash
az login
bash iac-setup.sh <salt>
```

There should be some JSON output visible from the bicep/ARM deployment. You can verify a successful run if the `.env` file was created in the same directory and contains values in the sections `#### Values from IaC #####` and `#### Values from Post Deployment #####`.

## Configure Azure DevOps Pipelines

Great you are now ready to set up your Azure DevOps Project you prepared [earlier](#prerequisite).

First add your values to the following keys in the `.env` file:

|Key|Value Description|
|---|---|
|AZURE_DEVOPS_EXT_GITHUB_PAT|A [GitHub PAT]((https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)) with scope `admin:repo_hook`|
|YOUR_GIT_HUB_ID|Your [GitHub ID](https://github.com/join) sometimes called `handle`|
|YOUR_AZURE_DEV_OPS_ORG|Your Azure DevOps [Organization Name](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/create-organization?view=azure-devops)|
|YOUR_AZURE_DEV_OPS_PROJECT_NAME|Your Azure DevOps [Project Name](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/projects/create-project?view=azure-devops&tabs=preview-page)|

```text
#### Please exchange the values as described in README.md #####

AZURE_DEVOPS_EXT_GITHUB_PAT=''
YOUR_GIT_HUB_ID=''
YOUR_AZURE_DEV_OPS_ORG=''
YOUR_AZURE_DEV_OPS_PROJECT_NAME=''
```

So everything set up run this command from within the `samples/mlops-for-azure-custom-question-answering` folder:

```bash
bash pipeline-setup.sh
```

You should see some JSON results from each of the commands and some warnings that the Azure CLI commands are in preview.

> HINT: If your Azure Subscription account is different from your Azure DevOps account you can `az logout` and `az login` again with your Azure DevOps account before running `pipeline-setup.sh`.

You can verify if everything worked by checking following three menus in your Azure DevOps project:

* Pipelines->Pipelines

    ![PipelinesCreated](.images/pipelines_menu.png)

* Pipelines->Environments

    ![EnvironmentsCreated](.images/environments_menu.png)

* Pipelines->Library

    ![LibraryCreated](.images/library_menu.png)

## Run the Pipelines

So now you are set up to execute the pipelines. The pipelines will ask you for permissions to access the Variable Groups and permission to deploy to the environments.

|Pipeline|What it does|How to explore|
|---|---|---|
|[Train Only](devops_pipelines/kb/KB-Train-only.yml)|Publish Knowledgebase from Test slot of CQA to Prod slot on the EDIT environment, run accuracy test and upload results to storage|Look at the test results within the pipeline run, check the created artifacts in the storage account|
|[Train & Deploy](devops_pipelines/kb/KB-CD-Manual.yml)|Train Only + deploying the Knowledgbase content to Prod slot of CQA in the PROD environment|Go to https://www.qnamaker.ai portal and add additional QnA Pairs to the Edit Knowledgebase, rerun the pipeline and verify in the Portal that the changes are now also in the Production Knowledgebase|
|[Deploy Previous](devops_pipelines/kb/KB-CD-PreviousVersion.yml)|Loading a Knowledegbase version from storage account and deploy it to the PROD environment|Go to the storage account and copy one of the folder names, run this pipeline and verify that the contents of the KB.json file is now matching with the Knowledgebase in the PROD environment|
|[Merge Active Learning Feedback](devops_pipelines/al/AL-Merge-Manual.yml)|Will save a copy of the Knowledgebase in the PROD environment, and merge and Active Learning Data with the Knowledgebase in the EDIT environment|Use the PROD environment, ask questions (e.g. with the Test tool provided in the portal), as soon as you get [Active Learning Feedback data displayed](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/qnamaker/how-to/improve-knowledge-base#view-suggested-questions) in the PROD environment Knowledgebase run this pipeline and verify that afterwards you see the Active Learning Feedback also in the EDIT environment Knowledgebase|

## Cleanup

In order to clean up the Azure resources please run following script from within the `samples/mlops-for-azure-custom-question-answering` folder. There will be a confirmation prompt before deleting the Azure resources.

```bash
bash cleanup.sh
```

To cleanup Azure DevOps please [delete the project](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/projects/delete-project?view=azure-devops&tabs=browser) you created for this sample.

# How does it work

## Background

While Custom Question Answering already has a two states for Knowledgebases namely `test` and `published` most organization demanding logical identical test environments next to a production environment.
Some have even several test environments getting more and more similar to the production environment to do additional infrastructure related tests. So this means that we can not use a single Custom Question Answering service in these settings.

## Conceptual Architecture and MLOps flow

The below diagram shows the conceptual architecture and MLOps flow. Important to note is that a `Content Administrator` will only be allowed to modify Knowledgebases on the `Content Editing` (called `EDIT` in the scripts and pipelines) environment, which will also be used for testing/accuracy tests. This could be the QA/UAT/Testing environment in your organization, or an additional environment just for content editing.

The service users will ask their questions against the endpoint in the `Content Serving` environment (called `PROD` in the scripts and pipelines). So as a result in the service in this environment the Active Feedback Suggestions will be gathered. But the `Content Administrators` can not see it. So we need to synchronize that data back to the `Content Editing` environment as well.

One of our main goals is to automate the testing and deployment process for new or edited content on the `Content Editing` environment. This automation is encapsuled in the [Azure DevOps pipelines](#run-the-pipelines) mentioned earlier.

## Components for MLOps on Custom Question Answering

We need following components/automated tasks for setting up our MLOps process for Custom Question Answering:

1. Publish changes in Knowledgebases from `test` to `published` state
1. Accuracy test using a test dataset
1. Exporting Knowledgebases
1. Store a set of current Knowledgebase state together with test data set and test results
1. Importing Knowledgebases
1. Merge Active Learning Suggestions into an existing Knowledgebase

The components for 1./3./5. were developed in Python and leveraging the Custom Question Answering REST API. Also [these scripts](kb/scripts) only point to one Custom Question Answering service at a time, input and output are in the JSON format defined by Custom Question Answering service.
This was done to be able to use them even when the environments are network isolated and can not be reached from within the same machine at once.

The [merge logic for 6.](kb/scripts/merge-kb.py) was implemented by us since there was not tool around to do that.

Component for 4. the archive/store for all history runs will be Azure Storage and we just leveraging the Azure CLI capabilities to upload and download the artifacts to and from there.

For component 2. accuracy test we developed a [TypeScript based tool](accuracy_test) which also leverages the Custom Question Answering REST API and needs a simple [TSV input file](data/test_en.tsv) for the test data.

## MLOps Pipelines

The pipelines itself just orchestrating the execution of components mentioned before in the right order. What each pipeline does is explained [here](#run-the-pipelines).
